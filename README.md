# NebuLua

NebuLua is a Game emulator for running games inside of terminal. This project is primarily for me to practice my coding skills.

## Development

> [!Note]
> The project is currently in development phase, if you want to try it on your own you can clone the repo and build it on your own.

### 1. Cloning the repository

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The project includes lua as a submodule, so don't forget to recurse the submodules

    Clone the repository with submodules:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Witty-Wizard/NebuLua.git --recursive
    ```

### 2. Building the Source Code

## TL;DR
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I am too lazy to write the `README`, be a good sport and read the code to see how it compiles, it uses `CMake` so it should not be that difficult and dont forget to install ncurses on your system.
